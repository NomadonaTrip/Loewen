                <h2>Brush Clearing</h2>                
                <p>We have experience removing dense thorny brush on hillsides as well as more friendly brush in level situations. Depending upon the exact situation, we use a handheld brush cutter, a chainsaw, and long-handled pruners. Part of the brush clearing is what to do with the brush after it is cut. In some situations it can be left elsewhere on the property. In others, it must be removed from the property. Another question is what to do with the roots remaining in the soil (in future years they will likely grow shoots and the brush situation will return). If there is just a little brush being cut out, often the roots can be dug up. If there is a lot of brush being cut and digging up all the roots is impractical, there could be another solution to keep it from growing such as bringing in a professional pesticide applicator to apply a product to kill the roots. Further, you may wish to consider some sort of cover to be planted which will resist other unwanted woody plants and weeds from growing on the now bare ground in the future. On the other hand, if just a short-term brush solution is required, then dealing with the cut stems and roots and even establishing a desirable vegetative cover may not be a concern. These are all the questions we can discuss with you prior to tackling this.</p>
